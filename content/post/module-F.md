# Introduction

Read each of the sections below and complete all the activities. Once you reach the end, there is a link to OSM where you can upload evidence of your work from the activities. OSM is how we keep track of your progress so you must complete it to have evidence of this module. You can either write your work digitally or take a picture of any pieces of paper you use. However you choose, make sure you keep track of your work to get the recognition.

This module will take you 45 minutes to an hour to complete.

## Objectives

This module will teach you how to create an environment that is inclusive and welcoming for all young people in the section. It will give you an understanding of some different additional needs a young person might have, and show you how to make reasonable adjustments to make the programme more inclusive for all.

By the end of the module, you will be able to:

- understand that every young person is different
- understand that every young person is welcome in Scouting
- understand your role in contributing to a positive and inclusive environment
- state a range of additional needs may affect participation in the programme
- explain how to adapt programmes to meet the needs of all young people within the section
- explain were to go further information and guidance

## Diversity and inclusion

The concept of diversity encompasses recognising people as individuals, understanding that everybody is unique and that we should respect our individual differences. These differences may include, but are not limited to, age, gender, backgrounds, and abilities and disabilities. Encouraging diversity in Scouting promotes respects for different ideas and perspectives as well as an understanding of differences that can impact on others.

When we talk about inclusion in Scouting, we are talking about the act of ensuring that Scouting is open to all and supporting anyone to overcome any barrier to participating in the Scouting programme. As part of being inclusive, we need to ensure that our programme and meeting place is appropriate and that we have considered any additional needs members might have.

It is important to consider diversity and inclusion as at its core Scouting is an inclusive, values-based movement and membership is open to all those who share our fundamental values. A personâ€™s differences and uniqueness should be encouraged and celebrated.

## Activity 1

Write down what inclusion and diversity mean to you, and why they are important in Scouting. Do you think your section/group is fully inclusive?

To run activities in your section that will help to explore the themes of diversity and inclusion, have a look at the following badges for your section level:

## Additional needs and disabilities

Additional needs and disabilities may be visible or invisible, and the needs of each young person will be unique. Some may occur for a limited period of time. For example, a broken arm, an illness, or some emotional needs due to a family break-up, are all temporary needs.

However, many additional needs are permanent conditions. These include conditions such as asthma, ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder), dyslexia or physical disabilities.

Some additional needs can fluctuate and may be affected by a range of different factors, such as stress. Additional needs and disabilities should not prevent a young person from being able to participate in Scouting. By making reasonable adjustments (doing things differently or providing additional support), most young people can access Scouting and develop to their full potential.

It is also important to be aware of any allergies, medical needs, faith or cultural needs a young person may have. For example, you may need to cater for vegetarian, Halal and Kosher diets, or a young person who is coeliac or has a nut allergy and ensure that their needs are incorporated into section meetings and camps.

## Activity 3

Match the celebrity with their additional need:

All these celebrities have some form of additional needs, but they have not prevented them from excelling in their respective fields. Just because someone has some form of additional needs, it should not stop them from joining in and pursuing things that they are interested in.
