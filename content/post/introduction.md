Welcome to Young Leader Training Online!

We have set out 9 of the 11 modules required to achive your Young Leader Belt, along with the missions. We have been given guidance by Scouts UK not to run Module A online. If you need to do this module don't worry, you will be able to complete it once we return to face to face meetings. This will be the same for Module K - first aid. You can still continue your training by completing some of the other modules we do have here.

This website has been put together in cooperation between Braid and Pentland District's Young Leader Training Teams. The team consists of Allison Gamble (ESL-YL Braid), Scott Robinson (ESL-YL Pentland), Fraser Liddle (AESL-YL Pentland), Ryan Schuller (AESL-YL Braid) and Matthew Wilson (AESL-YL Braid). 

We have moved to an online version of training due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our goal is to facilitate any Young Leader who wishes to continue their training.

If you would like any further information please contact your ESL-YL:
