# Hello and Welcome

This page has been put together in cooperation between Braid and Pentland District's Young Leader Training Teams. The Training consists of Allison Gamble (ESL-YL Braid), Scott Robinson (ESL-YL Pentland), Fraser Liddle (AESL-YL Pentland), Ryan Schuller (AESL-YL Braid) and Matthew Wilson (AESL-YL Braid). 

We have moved to an online version of training due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our goal is to facilitate any Young Leader who wishes to continue their training.

If you would like any further information please contact your ESL-YL:
