# Introduction

Read each of the sections below and complete all the activities. Once you reach the end, there is a link to OSM where you can upload evidence of your work from the activities. OSM is how we keep track of your progress so you must complete it to have evidence of this module. You can either write your work digitally or take a picture of any pieces of paper you use. However you choose, make sure you keep track of your work to get the recognition.

This module will take you 45 minutes to an hour to complete.

## Objectives

The aim of this module is to give you, as a Young Leader, a basic understanding of the different behaviours that young people can display and some possible causes. By the end, you should be able to recognise and propose possible solutions for different behaviours.

By the end of this module, you will:

- understand different types of behaviour
- understand and talk about the causes and triggers that can lead to different types of behaviour
- demonstrate a number of tools or methods that could be used to manage behaviour
- explain how you, as a Young Leader, can assist with managing behaviour in the section
- explain where you can get further assistance, and when to involve adults

## Approaching behaviour

Every young person is an individual and all young people should be treated equally. They can display a range of behaviours that can be both positive and negative. A sudden or noticeable change in behaviour may be due to a variety of underlying causes of which you might not be aware.

All volunteers should focus on recognising and rewarding positive behaviour, and should never label a young person or adult.

When speaking about behaviour in the section, volunteers should focus on the behaviour itself, rather than on the young person in question. For example, instead of saying that young person is being ‘naughty’, they could talk to the young person about their behaviour, clearly explaining why it is not appropriate. Responding to challenging behaviour can be difficult for all leaders at times.

## Activity 1

In this activity you will be reflecting on your own experiences. Write down an answer to each of the following questions.

- How do you feel if you are having a bad day?
- How do you feel when you are hungry?
- How do you feel when you are tired?
- How do you feel when you don’t understand something?
- How do you feel when you are having a really good day?
- Is there anything that helps you function a little better when you are having a bad day?
- What and who influences your mood?
- What brings out the best in you?

<!-- Everyone has good days and bad days. Some people's good days are getting there test results back and have the highest result in class while others getting them back and may have not passed. Think about how you would act if you had got the highest mark in class compared to if you got the lowest and how you feel and how you would act around others. I you had the highest mark you would be really happy and proud of yourself but if you had the lowest you may feel upset with yourself and disappointed. At this point think about what would make you feel more upset and note it down.

This is what can be know as a trigger something which creates something like a if you hand’t passed and a class mate says “have you got a brain” it would possibly upset you, anger you or evanescence’s make you feel uncomfortable. -->

## Reasons for behaviour

There is always a reason behind challenging behaviour. Examples could include: boredom, over-excitement, enthusiasm, a misunderstanding about what is appropriate behaviour, a misunderstanding understanding the rules, experiences outside of Scouting, experiencing a bad mental health day and the environment (e.g. noisy, overwhelming, unfamiliar).

Challenging behaviour is often misjudged as ‘attention seeking’. It’s natural to want and need attention from others, but usually this is sought in a positive way. It’s important to think about why a young person might be seeking attention. Are they receiving enough positive attention from adults? Is there something important they are struggling to communicate to you? Do they need support with developing friendships in the section?

## Activity 2

Write a list of 5 challenging behaviours you could encounter in your section.

Once you have written your list, think about the causes behind each one and write it down next to your list.

- If someone is experiencing boredom, what can we do to ensure the programme is inclusive and interesting? How can we make sure everyone understands?
- If someone is struggling to understand something, can we present the information in a different way? Can we have extra people on board to support? Can we check for any differences in how young people in the section learn, and adapt our leadership style to suit them?
- If someone is over-excited, can we set clear boundaries before the activity begins? Can we make sure we have a code of conduct in place?

<!-- For example, if you had a scout who was refusing to take part in an activity, this could be classed as playing up but the cause could be boredom. -->

<!-- Please watch the attached video about challenging behaviour-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvqbh_8mp-U -->

<!-- Think about if you have a young person in your section what helps them partisapte in activities and note it down. (??? GDPR) -->

## Managing behaviour

One way ESYLs can provide a positive environment is by creating a Code of Conduct in partnership with their section. A Code of Conduct is not just a list of rules for young people to follow. It can include rules for the leadership team to follow, too. You should consider how the leadership team should respond if a young person is having a bad day.

## Activity 3

Watch the video below about code of conduct:

From watching that video, create a code of conduct for the young leaders scheme.

## Conclusion

Look back at the objectives at the top of this page and see if you think you are confident with each of them. If there are any parts you are unsure of then you can contact the YL training team with any questions. If you do think you know everything then go to OSM to upload your evidence for each activity there. You need to complete this to be signed off.

1. Click on the "Badges" tab on the left side
2. Click on the "Young Leader Modules" badge in "Challenge Badges"
3. Click "Complete at home" and follow the instructions

Once you have uploaded your evidence and a leader has reviewed it, you may be invited to a Zoom call to talk through the module.

Thank you for taking the time to do training at home, stay safe :)
