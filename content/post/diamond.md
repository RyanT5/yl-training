# Introduction

The Chief Scout's Diamond Award is the highest of the Chief Scout's Awards. If you don't have [Platinum](/chief-scouts-platinum) yet then we recommend doing that first.

## What you have to do

There are four main tasks you need to complete to get your Chief Scout's Diamond Award. Some of them may sound daunting but remember that this award is meant to be completed over several months and you can always ask leaders for help if you get stuck.

Requirements can be adapted to suit each young person's abilities. You can read about [reasonable adjustments](https://www.scouts.org.uk/volunteers/equity-diversity-and-inclusion/supporting-people-with-additional-needs/agreeing-adjustments/adjustments-to-badges-and-awards/) on the Scouts UK website.

#### Logbook

Please download the [Diamond logbook](https://prod-cms.scouts.org.uk/media/x2mpnjp5/cheif-scout-diamond-award-log-book-march-2025.pdf) to help you keep track of your accomplishments for this award. Remember, it is your responsibility to keep this up to date.

#### Membership

You must have been a member of Explorer Scouts or Scout Network or both for at least 12 months at the time you complete the award.

#### Nights away

You must complete 16 nights away as an Explorer Scout or member of Scout Network, of which 8 must be camping. Any Scouting nights away can count for this section, whether used in another part of this award, or to count towards the [Chief Scout’s Platinum Award](/chief-scouts-platinum).

#### International, community & values (ICV) list

You must complete four activities in total, at least one from each topic area of the <a href="https://www.scouts.org.uk/explorers/chief-scout-s-diamond-award-icv-list" target="_blank">ICV activities list</a> and then an extra one.

If you have completed your [Chief Scout’s Platinum Award](/chief-scouts-platinum), you will have already done two activities and will only need to do a further two activities.

#### DofE Silver or equivalent

If you aren't working towards it already, you can find information on DofE Silver [here](/dofe-silver).

The reason we say "or equivalent" is that you technically do not need to have been awarded DofE Silver to finish your Chief Scout's Diamond Award but the requirements for this section are identical. If you are going to put in the effort, we encourage you to get Duke of Edinburgh while you are at it.

## Evidence

To show you have completed these tasks we ask you to write a little bit about your experience and upload it to OSM or email it to your leader. If you are not sure about how much or what type of evidence you need for a task you should contact your leader as early as possible. Evidence is crucial to making sure you get recognition.

You also don’t need to wait until you are finished every task to start submitting evidence. Submitting as soon as you are finished each task or subtask means we can ensure your work meets the requirements.

Please contact your Team Lead for Young Leaders or your 14-24 Team Lead for your District who will be able to advise if you can upload the evidence to OSM or if they would prefer the evidence a different way.

If there are any parts you are unsure of then you can [contact](/contact) the YL training team with any questions.

Thank you for taking the time to complete this at home :)
