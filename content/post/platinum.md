# Introduction

The Chief Scout's Platinum Award is one of the top awards for Explorers. It's a chance to celebrate your progress, and take stock of how far you've come in Scouts.

## What you have to do

There are four main tasks you need to complete to get your Chief Scout's Platinum Award. Some of them may sound daunting but remember that this award is meant to be completed over several months and you can always ask leaders for help if you get stuck.

Requirements can be adapted to suit each young person's abilities. You can read about reasonable adjustments [here](https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/1301/policy-and-approach).

#### Membership

You must have been a member of Explorer Scouts for at least 6 months at the time you complete the award.

#### Nights away

You must complete 6 nights away as an Explorer Scout or member of Scout Network, of which 4 must be camping. This must not include any nights away for DofE expeditions or equivalent expeditions for this award.

#### International, community & values (ICV) list

You must complete two activities from the [ICV activities list](https://www.scouts.org.uk/explorers/chief-scout-s-platinum-award-icv-list). You can pick any two but we recommend doing two from different catagories. Speak to your leader if have any questions.

#### DofE Bronze or equivalent

If you aren't working towards it already, you can find information on DofE Bronze [here](/dofe-bronze).

The reason we say "or equivalent" is that you technically do not need to have been awarded DofE Silver to finish your Chief Scout's Platinum Award but the requirements for this section are identical. If you are going to put in the effort, we encourage you to get Duke of Edinburgh while you are at it.

## Evidence

To show you have completed these tasks we ask you to write a little bit about your experience and upload it to OSM. If you are not sure about how much or what type of evidence you need for a task you should contact your leader as early as possible. Evidence is crucial to making sure you get recognition.

You also donâ€™t need to wait until you are finished every task to start uploading evidence. Uploading as soon as you are finished each task or subtask means we can ensure your work meets the requirements.

You can download [this logbook](https://cms.scouts.org.uk/media/12404/chief-scout-platinum-award-log-book-june-2019.pdf) as a guide.
