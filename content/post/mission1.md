# Introduction

In order to show you have learned from the training, you must also complete all 4 missions. These may sound like massive tasks but if you are taking an active role in your section then you might have completed them already!

Below it explains what you have to do to complete this mission as well as how to get it signed off.

## What you have to do

Plan and run a minimum of three games with the section you are volunteering with. At least one game should take place indoors and one outdoors.

The games should be varied, incorporating:

- at least two different types of leadership style ([Module B](/module-b) and [Module C](/module-c))

- three different types of games; for example some games may be more energetic and active, while others may be more creative or reflective ([Module E](/module-e))

To complete this mission, you could:

- run a game at the beginning or end of a section night
- run a wide game on a camp
- run a game that ties into a badge the section is working towards
- run a game that reinforces something the section has learned
- any other ideas, subject to agreement with ESLYL and SL

This could be done in a virtual section meeting too!

## Evidence

To show you have completed these tasks we ask you to write a little bit about your experience and upload it to OSM or email it to your leader. Fill in the Mission 1 page of your logbook. If you don't have a logbook then for each of the three games you ran, please make notes on:

- date
- location
- leadership styles used
- game type
- instructions of the game
- equipment needed
- badges/awards worked towards
- self evaluation of how it went

Once you have done this for all three, you can submit the evidence to your leader for review.

Please contact your Team Lead for Young Leaders or your 14-24 Team Lead for your District who will be able to advise if you can upload the evidence to OSM or if they would prefer the evidence a different way.

If there are any parts you are unsure of then you can [contact](/contact) the YL training team with any questions.

Thank you for taking the time to complete this at home :)
