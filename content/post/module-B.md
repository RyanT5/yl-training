# Introduction

Read each of the sections below and complete all the activities. Once you reach the end, there is a link to a quiz where you can test your knowledge. The quiz is how we keep track of your progress so you must complete it to have evidence of this module. You will also be asked to upload pictures of your work from the activities so please write things down and keep track of your work.

This module will likely take you about an hour and a half.

## Objectives

This module aims to introduce you to the different concepts of leadership. It will teach you how to adapt your style so you can most effectively lead different kinds of activities.

By the end of this module, you will:

- have the confidence to take on a leadership role within your chosen section
- be able to run programme activities that are appropriate for your role
- recognise different leadership styles and understand when each should be used to best effect
- recognise how different styles of leadership impact an activity
- understand the need for evaluation, and know how to implement the process as necessary

## What makes leaders effective?

- generate ideas
- plan
- encourage others
- help people learn
- ask reflective questions like ‘Did it work?’, ‘Why?’, or ‘Would we change anything?’
- let people know when they have done a good job
- ask for help
- are team players
- learn by experience and from mistakes
- work within the rules
- give positive feedback
- know their Scouts and understand their strengths and weaknesses

## Activity 1

## Styles of leadership

## Activity 3

You will need at least one other family member to join you for this acivity, ideally more if they are available. Your job is to lead the team you've formed to build some sort of (temporary) stucture out of household objects. This could be a pillow fort, a bridge between tables or a throne you can sit in. We have intentionally kept this discription vague to ensure everyone can complete this activity regardless of their home situation, use your creativity. Think about leadership techniques you can use to improve your team's perfomance.

Make sure you get permission from a parent/guardian for any items you use that are not yours and remember to think about saftey at all times. When you are finished, take a picture of your team with what you have built.

## Conclusion

Look back at the objectives at the top of this page and see if you think you are confident with each of them. If there are any parts you are unsure of then you can contact the YL training team with any questions. If you do think you know everything then complete the quiz linked below.
