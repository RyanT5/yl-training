# Introduction

## What you have to do

## Evidence

To show you have completed these tasks we ask you to write a little bit about your experience and upload it to OSM. Fill in the Mission 1 page of your logbook. If you don't have a logbook then for each of the three games you ran, please make notes on:

- date
- location
- leadership styles used
- game type
- instructions of the game
- equipment needed
- badges/awards worked towards
- self evaluation of how it went

Once you have done this for all three, you can upload the evidence through OSM. If haven't used OSM before, check out our step-by-step guide by clicking [here](/evidence).

Once you are logged in:

1. Click on the "Badges" tab on the left side under your name
2. Click on the "Young Leader Mission 1" badge under "Challenge Badges"
3. Click "Complete at home" and follow the instructions

</a>

If there are any parts you are unsure of then you can [contact](/contact) the YL training team with any questions.

Thank you for taking the time to complete this at home, stay safe :)
