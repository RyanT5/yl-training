Welcome to Young Leader Training Online!

We have set out 9 of the 11 modules required to achive your Young Leader Belt. We have been given guidance by Scouts UK not to run Module A online. If you need to do this module don't worry, you will be able to complete it once we return to face to face meetings. This will be the same for Module K - first aid. You can still continue your training by completing some of the other modules we do have here.

If you would like more info then check out our [About](/about) page.
