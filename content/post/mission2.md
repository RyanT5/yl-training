# Introduction

In order to show you have learned from the training, you must also complete all 4 missions. These may sound like massive tasks but if you are taking an active role in your section then you might have completed them already!

Below it explains what you have to do to complete this mission as well as how to get it signed off.

## What you have to do

Plan and run an activity (not a game) with the section you are volunteering with.

The activities should include:

- planning and organisation

- gathering any equipment or materials needed

- delivery

To complete this mission, you could:

- choose an activity badge to run as part of the programme, providing all of the information and materials required for the section to achieve this

- run a segment of the camp programme, such as a pioneering activity or obstacle course, planning the route for a hike, initiating some team challenges, or organising and leading a campfire

- record the ways in which your sectionâ€™s programme activities could count towards different badges and awards

- run an activity for the section, relating to one of your own hobbies or interests

- any other ideas, subject to agreement with the ESLYL and SL

This could be done in a virtual section meeting too!

## Evidence

To show you have completed these tasks we ask you to write a little bit about your experience and upload it to OSM or email it to your leader. Fill in the Mission 2 page of your logbook. If you don't have a logbook then for the activity you choose, please make notes on:

- date
- location
- badges/awards worked towards
- activity instructions
- equipment needed
- self evaluation of how it went

Once you have done this, you can submit the evidence to your leader for review.

Please contact your Team Lead for Young Leaders or your 14-24 Team Lead for your District who will be able to advise if you can upload the evidence to OSM or if they would prefer the evidence a different way.

If there are any parts you are unsure of then you can [contact](/contact) the YL training team with any questions.

Thank you for taking the time to complete this at home :)
