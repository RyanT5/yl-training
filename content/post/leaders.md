This page has been put together by the Website Development Team to provide guidance to Leaders on how we organise and run our online training and hopefully help you organise your own.

One of the main questions we get is if this website is only for the use of Braid and Pentland or if others aross the UK can use it too. We not only allow but actively encourage you to use this website to support your own training if you think it would be helpful. Our resources have been fully [endorsed by Scouts UK](https://www.scouts.org.uk/volunteers/running-your-section/running-an-explorer-unit/explorers-covid-19-safe-games-and-activities/) and we intend to keep them up to date into the future.

### The use of Online Scout Manager (OSM)

We use Online Scout Manager to accept Young Leader’s evidence for Modules or Missions through using the ‘Badges at Home’ function. This will assist the administration of your Young Leader Unit through the below steps laid out.

If you've never used it before, Online Scout Manager allows for all of your administration for your Group, Section or Explorer Unit to be in one place. Allowing for functions like: Group/Section Management of Personal Records, Badge Records, Programme Planning Functions, Parent Portal Options & lately the option for ‘Badges at Home function’.

OSM allows Leaders to select different packages so you can customise it to your needs. Every Scout Group / Explorer Unit will have their own way of keeping track of how Young Leaders progress through their training. We suggest that if you opt for utilising the Young Leader Training Website, it is built to assist with the ‘Badges at Home’ function which can be found under the “Additional Upgrades on their pricing strategy.

<!-- For more support on how you can access and utilise the function of ‘Badges at Home’, can be found here:

### How to use the Young Leader Training website

The Website Development Team have spent time understanding and recognising how the Young Leaders Scheme can be offered via e-learning where possible and ensuring that the importance of the Modules have not been lost through e-learning.

Each Module offers a range of activities, the Website Development Team’s hope was to make the activities individual led, however, there are times when we suggest that a parent, sibling or friend may come in useful. Each Module and Mission has been checked that it meets the requirements through the use of the ‘Prepare to Lead’ book produced by the UK Scouts Association.

<!-- ### Further information

This page has been developed to provide advice and guidance to Leaders on how Young Leader Training led through e-learning. Although further advice on the Young Leader Scheme can be found [here](https://www.scouts.org.uk/explorers/awards/young-leader-award). -->
