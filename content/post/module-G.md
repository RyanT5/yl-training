# Introduction

Read each of the sections below and complete all the activities. Once you reach the end, there is a link to OSM where you can upload evidence of your work from the activities. OSM is how we keep track of your progress so you must complete it to have evidence of this module. You can either write your work digitally or take a picture of any pieces of paper you use. However you choose, make sure you keep track of your work to get the recognition.

This module will take you an hour to an hour and a half to complete.

## Objectives

This module aims to provide you with the knowledge of what a high quality, balanced programme is and looks like for the section support. It will help you to understand how awards and badges help to achieve this. It will also give you tips on where to find ideas for planning a high quality programme and tips on reviewing the programme to ensure that it is challenging, relevant and rewarding for each young person in the section.

By the end of this module, you will have an understanding of:

- the key elements of the younger section programmes, activity badges, challenge awards, requirements for completing top awards, and Staged Activity Badges
- how the awards and badges form a progressive Scheme from age 6 to 25
- the importance of having a balanced high quality programme and working towards the top awards
- how Moving On Awards improve links between sections
- what makes us unique as an organisation
- how to review the programme using the quality programme checkers

## Activity 1

Look through the list of activity badges for your section and divide them into three columns on a piece of paper. Your columns should cover the three themes of ‘outdoor and adventure’, ‘world’ and ‘skills’.

If you work with Beavers, you can see their badges [here](https://www.scouts.org.uk/beavers/activity-badges/).  
If you work with Cubs, you can see their badges [here](https://www.scouts.org.uk/cubs/activity-badges/).  
If you work with Scouts, you can see their badges [here](https://www.scouts.org.uk/scouts/activity-badges/).

A balanced programme should have elements from all three themes in each term of meetings. Reflect on which themes your section has focused on most in the time you've been there and come up with some ideas for what you could do to diversify.

## Youth Shaped Scouting

Young people working in partnership with adults in Scouting has always been something we have been proud of. Youth Shaped Scouting not only improves the way we Scout, but also the young people involved. Learning to speak up, be heard and work towards improving something you are passionate about is an incredible learning experience for the youngest Beaver right the way through to our eldest Network member.

We want every young person to shape their own adventure, take on responsibility, develop skills, make decisions and influence their own Scout Programme.

There are lots of things that you can do to help this happen; from introducing section youth forums to encouraging young people to record video vlogs to share and reflect on past activities and decisions made in the section. These can be done in fun and exciting ways.

## Activity 2

Make a poster aimed at parents explaining all the key information about your section. Include information about your programme, awards and skills that young people will learn through Scouting.

## Quality Programme

A Quality Programme is Challenging, Relevant and Rewarding for every young person.

###### What we mean by Challenging:

- more opportunities for outdoor and adventurous activities in safe environments
- gaining confidence by participating in new or less familiar activities and stepping out of their comfort zones
- all young people regardless of their abilities can enjoy and achieve 

###### What we mean by Relevant:

- young people shape the programme based on what they want to learn and explore
- ensuring the needs of every young person are met
- responding to what young people are currently inquisitive about and reflecting this in the programme

###### What we mean by Rewarding:

- developing skills for life, including teamwork and leadership
- supporting young people with their progression through the sections
- young people are excited about Scouting, having fun and increasing in confidence

## Reviewing programme

The Scout Association have put together a number of tools you can use to review your programme. There are different review tools for each section.

If you work with Beavers, you can see their review [here](https://members.scouts.org.uk/documents/6to25/Beaver%20Quality%20Programme%20Checker%20%202018.pdf).  
If you work with Cubs, you can see their review [here](https://members.scouts.org.uk/documents/6to25/Cubs%20Quality%20Programme%20Checker%202018.pdf).  
If you work with Scouts, you can see their review [here](https://members.scouts.org.uk/documents/Quality%20Programme%20Checker_Scouts.pdf).

## Activity 3

Plan a linking evening for your section and the section either above or below yours that would help young people transitioning between. Think about the following:

- Which activities would be appropriate?
- How would you mix the two sections together?
- Which elements of the programme are relevant to both sections (e.g. Staged Badges)?

## Conclusion

Look back at the objectives at the top of this page and see if you think you are confident with each of them. If there are any parts you are unsure of then you can [contact](/contact) the YL training team with any questions. If you do think you know everything then go to OSM to upload your evidence for each activity there. You need to complete this to be signed off.

Once you are logged in:

1. Click on the "Badges" tab on the left side under your name
