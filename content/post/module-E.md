# Introduction

Read each of the sections below and complete all the activities. Once you reach the end, there is a link to OSM where you can upload evidence of your work from the activities. OSM is how we keep track of your progress so you must complete it to have evidence of this module. You can either write your work digitally or take a picture of any pieces of paper you use. However you choose, make sure you keep track of your work to get the recognition.

This module will take you 45 minutes to an hour to complete.

## Objectives

The aim of this module is to give YLs a good understanding of the importance of games in the section meeting. It will give you an idea of the different types of games that can be played and when to use them to greatest effect.

By the end of this module, you will have an understanding of:

- the importance of games in the section meeting
- the need for different types of games and when to play them
- how to explain and run different types of games
- how to select games that suit the sectionâ€™s programme

## Games in Scouting

Games are a popular part of any section meeting. As well as being fun, games are a useful tool to help with learning and team building. Many sections start their meeting with an active game to help young people burn off any excess energy they arrive with but games can be tied in with almost any activity in Scouting.

## Activity 1

This activity is straightforward. Create a list of all the games you can think of that you could play in your section. These could be ones that have been played there recently, games you might have played if you were in that section when you were younger or even games you have played at school. See if you can come up with a game starting with every letter of the alphabet.

## Types of games

There are many different types of games you can play and it is good to have a variety to keep young people engaged. Some examples of different types of games you can play include:

- team-based or individual games
- indoor or outdoor games
- competitive or non-competitive games
- team-building games
- skill-based games
- observational games
- elimination games
- energetic or restful games
- games to start or end a meeting
- relay races

If you can come up with an original game that is age-appropriate to your section then that is even better and allows you to take a more active role as a YL.

## Activity 2

Another important aspect of Scouting is working towards badges. In this activity, you need to look through the list of badges for your section and either match them with games in your list from Activity 1 or come up with other possible games that would fit. Do this for at least 10 badges.

If you work with Beavers, you can see their badges [here](https://www.scouts.org.uk/beavers/activity-badges/).  
If you work with Cubs, you can see their badges [here](https://www.scouts.org.uk/cubs/activity-badges/).  
If you work with Scouts, you can see their badges [here](https://www.scouts.org.uk/scouts/activity-badges/).

## Preparation

To run games successfully, preparation is vital. Think about each of the following points and how you could go about making sure you complete them all.

- having the correct equipment
- explaining the rules clearly and simply
- maintaining discipline and sporting behaviour during the game
- timekeeping
- safety (equipment and environment)
- supervision
- set up and clean up time

## Activity 3

By this point in the module, you should have loads of games in mind that you could play with your section. Now you need to take your preparation knowledge and put it to the test. Choose a game and go through the preparation process as if you were going to run it with the young people at your section. Then find a family member to play the game with and teach them how to play. Make notes of what you do at each step of preparation and running the game.

## Conclusion

Look back at the objectives at the top of this page and see if you think you are confident with each of them. If there are any parts you are unsure of then you can [contact](/contact) the YL training team with any questions. If you do think you know everything then go to OSM to upload your evidence for each activity there. You need to complete this to be signed off.
